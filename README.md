# Churn prediction of customers
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn — identifying whether a customer is likely to leave a service. Early prediction helps businesses retain customers and improve decision-making.

## 🚀 Features
- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing and categorical data
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and classification report
- Visualizations to understand data distribution and churn patterns

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – 
  - `LabelEncoder`, `StandardScaler`, `train_test_split`
  - `LogisticRegression` model
  - `classification_report` for evaluation
  - 
## 📌 Goal
Build a simple yet effective churn prediction model using logistic regression and interpret key features influencing churn.
